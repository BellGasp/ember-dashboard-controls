## Description
This Ember Addon simply wraps some of the new controls available in the [Dashboard Bootstrap Theme](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/products/dashboard) into an easy to use addon.

_N.B._ The theme itself is not included in this addon since it is a premium theme and requires a purchase.

## Installation

Like most ember addons, simply run `ember install ember-dashboard-controls` and you should be all set.
